# Machine_Learning
Compilation of practiced ML algorithms

The repository is my hands on with the subject. The book followed here is "Hands On Machine Learning with sckit-learn and tensorflow" 
by Aurelien Geron.

The code is getting updated as the Chapters flow. Please find the description of each notebook below:

EndtoEnd : Provides a good view of a Machine Learning Project looks like. It introduces to some tools and libraries that can be used to train 
a great system.

Classification : Running Random Forest model to predict MNIST dataset from sckit-learn package. The notebook provides insights to creating clasfication model and evaluating their accuracy.

airbnb : The notebook introduces key concepts related to data analysis of Airbnb(Amsterdam) data listings provided by Kaggle Compitetions.

ChurnEngine : Prediction model to churn the possibility of exit of Bank Customers. The data was provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)
